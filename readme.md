Hi, My name is Khushi and I created a small webpage which connects to the PokeApi, an API using Javascript.

Whenever we search for any pokemon, it dispalys the 
1) name of the pokemon
2) type
3) abilities
4) weight info
5) height info
6) attack
7) defence and many more in a json format. I have used html for the basic structure of the website, css for styling and javascript for the logic part.
